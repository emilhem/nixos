# emilhem's nixos configuration

After not having used NixOS in a couple years, I thought it was time for it again.

Don't use my repo for pointers on how to do things in Nix/NixOS, I'm still learning. :)

Old repo is here: https://github.com/emilhem/nixos-old

## Setup

1. Clone
2. Run `sudo ./install` to copy the files
3. Run `nixos-rebuild switch`
